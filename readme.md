Hello!

I'm Eli, a data analyst and storyteller.

- My first project involves building a predictive model that can curate a dynamic playlist which changes according to the weather.
- I primarily focused on Tokyo, Japan, but also explored applying the same modelling to Singapore.
- Includes a Tableau dashboard which provides a recommended number of songs per genre based on that day's weather.
